# 🌐 3.3 Part 2 — The Internet (IP): Addressing, Routing, and Supporting Protocols

## 3.3.5 Subnets and Subnet Masks

### 🔹 The Problem

Originally, IP addresses had two parts:

- **Network part:** identifies the network.  
- **Host part:** identifies the host within that network.  

However, this rigid structure (Class A, B, C networks) caused **waste**:

- Class A: too many addresses for small organizations.  
- Class C: too few for medium-sized networks.  

### 🔹 The Solution — Subnetting

Subnetting introduces a **third level**:  
**Network → Subnet → Host**

- A **subnet mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`) divides the host portion into **subnet ID** and **host ID**.  
- This allows organizations to manage their address space internally while appearing as a single network externally.

### 🔹 Benefits

- Reduces routing table size.  
- Enables hierarchical organization of networks.  
- Improves management and scalability.

## 3.3.6 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

### 🔹 Motivation

Even with subnetting, **class-based** addressing caused problems:

- Routing tables grew too large.  
- Class B networks were exhausted too quickly.

### 🔹 CIDR Basics

CIDR removes rigid classes and introduces **variable-length prefixes**:

- Format: `IP_address/prefix_length`  
  - Example: `192.168.10.0/24`  

- The prefix length (e.g., `/24`) specifies how many bits identify the network.  
- Allows **route aggregation (supernetting)** — combining multiple smaller networks into one block.

### 🔹 Example

- Classful: `192.168.1.0` and `192.168.2.0` are separate networks.  
- CIDR: Combine into `192.168.0.0/22` (covers 4 contiguous Class C networks).

### 🔹 Advantages

- Reduces global routing table size.  
- Delays IPv4 exhaustion.  
- Makes address allocation more flexible.

## 3.3.7 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

### 🔹 Purpose

Translates **IP addresses (Layer 3)** to **MAC addresses (Layer 2)** within a local network.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. A host wants to send a packet to another host on the same LAN.  
2. It broadcasts an **ARP Request**: “Who has 192.168.1.5? Tell 192.168.1.2.”  
3. The target responds with an **ARP Reply**: “192.168.1.5 is at 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.”  
4. The sender stores the mapping in its **ARP table**.

### 🔹 Notes

- Works only within a single LAN (not across routers).  
- Routers use ARP to find the **next hop’s MAC address**.  
- Entries expire and must be refreshed periodically.

## 3.3.8 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

### 🔹 Purpose

Automatically assigns IP addresses and configuration details to hosts — no manual setup needed.

### 🔹 How It Works (DORA Process)

1. **Discover** – Client broadcasts to find DHCP servers.  
2. **Offer** – Server offers an IP and configuration.  
3. **Request** – Client requests one of the offers.  
4. **Acknowledge** – Server confirms and leases the IP.

### 🔹 What DHCP Provides

- IP address  
- Subnet mask  
- Default gateway (router)  
- DNS server(s)  
- Lease duration (temporary IP ownership)

### 🔹 Benefits

- Centralized address management.  
- Reuse of IPs via leases.  
- Ideal for mobile or temporary devices.

## 3.3.9 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

### 🔹 Purpose

Used by IP devices to send **error messages** and **network diagnostics** (control plane).

### 🔹 Common ICMP Messages

| Type | Function |
|------|-----------|
| **Echo Request/Reply** | Used by `ping` to test reachability. |
| **Destination Unreachable** | Indicates packet could not be delivered. |
| **Time Exceeded** | TTL expired (used by `traceroute`). |
| **Redirect** | Suggests a better route to a host. |

### 🔹 Notes

- ICMP is encapsulated within IP (Protocol = 1).  
- Not for data transport — only diagnostics and control.  
- Crucial for troubleshooting and routing behavior.

## 3.3.10 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Tunneling

### 🔹 The Problem

Organizations often need to securely connect private networks over the public Internet.

### 🔹 The Solution — Tunneling

Encapsulate one network’s packets **inside another**:  
**IP-in-IP** → a virtual “tunnel” across the Internet.

- **Outer header:** tunnel endpoint addresses (e.g., gateways).  
- **Inner header:** original source/destination within the private network.

### 🔹 VPNs

VPNs combine tunneling with **encryption and authentication** to form secure private links.

**Common Forms:**

- **Site-to-Site VPNs:** Connect branch offices securely.  
- **Remote Access VPNs:** Connect individual users to a private network.

### 🔹 Benefits

- Security via encryption and authentication.  
- Logical private networks on shared infrastructure.  
- Enables remote and hybrid work environments.
