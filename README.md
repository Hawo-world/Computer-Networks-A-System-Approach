## 📘 About This Repository
This repository contains my personal, **simplified study notes** from the textbook *Computer Networks: A Systems Approach* (6th Edition).  
The book is an in-depth, technical exploration of how computer networks are designed and operate — but it can be **dense** and **long**, especially for beginners or readers with shorter attention spans.  

My goal is to make it **digestible** and **easy to understand** — while preserving the accuracy and structure of the original material.  
Each chapter is organized into folders, and each file inside covers one section of that chapter.

## 🎯 Purpose
> “To make networking concepts approachable, concise, and visually clear.”

These notes are:
- 🧩 **Summarized:** Focused on key ideas, stripped of unnecessary complexity.  
- 🧠 **Conceptual:** Emphasizing *why* systems are designed a certain way.  
- 💡 **Readable:** Structured for quick scanning, with tables and callouts for clarity.  
- 📚 **Organized by Chapter:** Each folder represents one chapter from the book.  

Whether you’re a student, self-learner, or someone brushing up on networking fundamentals — these notes aim to help you grasp the *core principles* behind modern networks.

Each section includes:
- **Summary** – A concise overview of what the section covers  
- **Key Points** – Simplified explanations with visuals or tables where helpful
