# 🌐 Chapter 1.2 — Requirements (part1)

## 📘 Summary
This section introduces the **core requirements and design principles** of building computer networks from the ground up.  
It focuses on *why* networks are structured the way they are — helping you understand the reasoning behind their evolution, scalability, and efficiency as technology advances.

## 🔑 Key Points

### 🧩 1.2.1 Stakeholders

A well-designed network must satisfy the needs of **three main groups**:

| Stakeholder | Focus | Example Requirements |
|--------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Application Programmers** | Functionality & reliability | Guaranteed message delivery, fast performance, seamless mobility (e.g., switching between Wi-Fi and cellular). |
| **Network Operators** | Manageability & stability | Easy fault isolation, simple configuration for new devices, accurate usage tracking. |
| **Network Designers** | Efficiency & cost | Optimized resource use, fair bandwidth sharing, and high overall performance. |

> **Main takeaway:** Each stakeholder has unique priorities.  
> Understanding them helps define trade-offs that balance **performance, usability, and cost** — the heart of network design.

### 🌐 1.2.2 Scalable Connectivity

A network’s most fundamental goal is to **connect devices efficiently and at scale**.

#### a. Connectivity Basics
- **Links:** Physical communication paths (fiber optics, cables, wireless channels).  
- **Nodes:** Devices connected to the network.
  - *Hosts* use the network (e.g., computers, phones).  
  - *Switches/Routers* operate and manage traffic flow.
- **Point-to-Point Links:** Connect two nodes directly.  
- **Multiple-Access Links:** Shared by many nodes (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular).

#### b. Direct vs. Indirect Connections
- Directly linking every device is **impractical and expensive**.  
- **Indirect connectivity** via routers and switches enables scalability and cost-efficiency.

#### c. Network Types
- **Switched Networks:** Use switches to forward packets between nodes.  
  - *Circuit-switched:* Dedicated path per connection (like telephone lines).  
  - *Packet-switched:* Data divided into packets sent independently — used in modern computer networks.
- **Internetworks (Internets):**
  - Combine multiple smaller networks using routers or gateways.
  - The **Internet** (capital “I”) is the global-scale example — connecting networks of networks.

#### d. Addressing & Routing
- Each node has a unique **address**.  
- **Routing** determines how messages travel toward their destination.
- **Communication Types:**
  - *Unicast:* One-to-one  
  - *Broadcast:* One-to-all  
  - *Multicast:* One-to-many (selected group)

> **Main takeaway:** Networks scale by building hierarchically — from **links → networks → internetworks**.  
> Addressing and routing ensure data reaches its target efficiently.

### ⚙️ 1.2.3 Cost-Effective Resource Sharing

Networks must share limited resources (like bandwidth) **efficiently** while maintaining fairness and performance.

#### a. Multiplexing (Sharing the Network)
- **Multiplexing** = allowing multiple users to share a single resource (like a link).  
- Comparable to timesharing — users take turns sending data.

#### b. Multiplexing Methods

| Type | How It Works | Limitations |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **STDM (Synchronous Time-Division Multiplexing)** | Each flow gets a fixed time slot in round-robin order. | Idle time if no data to send; limited number of flows. |
| **FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing)** | Each flow gets its own frequency band. | Inflexible — adding new users or resizing channels is difficult. |
| **Statistical Multiplexing** | Data is sent on demand in variable slots; packets are interleaved as needed. | May cause congestion if too much data arrives too quickly. |

> **Statistical multiplexing** is the foundation of **packet switching** — enabling flexible, efficient, and cost-effective communication.

#### c. How Packet Switching Works
- Data is divided into **packets**, which travel independently across the network.  
- Switches forward packets dynamically, deciding which flow to handle next.  
- If incoming traffic exceeds capacity:
  - **Packets are buffered**, or  
  - **Dropped** when buffers overflow — leading to **congestion**.

#### d. Fairness and Quality of Service (QoS)
- **Fairness:** Switches can schedule packets via *FIFO* (First In, First Out) or *round-robin*.
- **QoS (Quality of Service):** Guarantees specific performance levels (bandwidth, delay, reliability) for critical data flows.

> **Main takeaway:** Statistical multiplexing allows many users to share network resources dynamically.  
> Managing congestion, fairness, and delay is essential for efficient performance.

## 📘 Key Takeaways (Overall)

- Network design must balance **functionality**, **manageability**, and **efficiency**.  
- Scalability arises from connecting smaller networks into **larger internetworks**.  
- **Packet switching** and **statistical multiplexing** allow cost-effective resource sharing.  
- **Addressing**, **routing**, and **QoS** ensure reliable communication across complex network structures.
