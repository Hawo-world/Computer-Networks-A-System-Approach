# üåê Chapter 1 ‚Äî Applications & Classes of Applications

## üìò Summary
This section explores how people use and experience the Internet, the key groups involved in its development and operation, and the major categories of Internet applications.  
It connects user experience (like web browsing or streaming) to the underlying network behaviors that make those experiences possible.

## üîë Key Points

### 1. Internet Users and Constituencies
The Internet involves multiple communities with different roles and perspectives:

- **Primary Users:**  
  Most people experience the Internet through applications like web browsers, email, social media, streaming, and messaging.

- **Application Developers:**  
  They create these services and tools. Development has become easier due to smartphones and high-level frameworks.

- **Network Operators:**  
  Manage and maintain the infrastructure that keeps the Internet running.  
  Even home users operate small-scale networks (e.g., Wi-Fi routers).

- **System Designers:**  
  Engineers who build the devices, architectures, and protocols that power Internet communication ‚Äî the main focus of networking studies.

> Understanding all four perspectives ‚Äî **users**, **developers**, **operators**, and **designers** ‚Äî helps create more efficient and user-friendly networks.

### 2. Classes of Internet Applications

#### üï∏Ô∏è The World Wide Web
- Made the Internet accessible to the public through linked multimedia pages (text, images, links).  
- Each element is identified by a **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** ‚Äî e.g.,  
  `http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~llp/index.html`
- Behind every click, multiple processes occur:
  - DNS resolution (converting names to IPs)
  - TCP connection setup
  - HTTP request and response exchanges
  - Connection termination
- A single page can trigger **dozens of network messages**, revealing the complexity behind simple interactions.

#### üéµ Streaming Audio and Video
- Examples: **YouTube, Spotify, Netflix**
- Delivers continuous data in real time ‚Äî users can start playback before the entire file downloads.
- Sensitive to **delay and bandwidth**; interruptions or lag degrade the user experience.
- Prioritizes **timely delivery** over perfect reliability.

#### üí¨ Real-Time Audio/Video (e.g., VoIP, Video Calls)
- Examples: **Zoom, Skype, Teams**
- Involves **two-way, live communication**, requiring extremely low latency (ideally under 300 ms round trip).
- Synchronizes **audio and video streams** while adapting to limited bandwidth.
- Even slight delays can disrupt the natural flow of conversation.

### 3. Implications for Network Design
Different applications impose different technical requirements:

| Type of Application | Key Requirement | Example |
|---------------------|------------------|----------|
| Web Browsing | Reliable delivery | HTTP over TCP |
| Streaming | Continuous data flow, minimal buffering | Netflix, Spotify |
| Real-Time Communication | Low latency, synchronization | Zoom, Teams |

A well-designed network must **balance reliability, speed, and interactivity** across all these use cases.  
Later chapters will classify (taxonomize) these application types to guide better network architecture.

## üßæ Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **Application** | A program or service people use to interact with the Internet (e.g., browsers, streaming apps). |
| **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** | A unique identifier that specifies where and how to access an online resource. |
| **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** | The standard protocol for transferring web content. |
| **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** | A numerical label identifying a device or server on the Internet. |
| **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** | Ensures reliable, ordered data delivery between computers. |
| **Streaming** | Continuous transfer of audio or video that plays as it downloads. |
| **Real-Time Communication** | Interaction that requires immediate feedback (e.g., calls, video chats). |
| **Latency** | Delay between sending and receiving data ‚Äî critical in real-time applications. |
| **Network Operator** | Manages the infrastructure enabling data to travel across networks. |
| **Protocol** | A set of rules that defines how devices communicate and exchange data. |

**üí° Insight:**  
Understanding how each type of Internet application interacts with the network helps engineers design systems that are responsive, efficient, and resilient ‚Äî balancing human experience with technical constraints.
