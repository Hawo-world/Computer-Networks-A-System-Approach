# üåê Chapter 2 ‚Äî Encoding

## üìò Summary
**Encoding** is the first step in turning a physical connection between two network nodes into a communication channel capable of transmitting bits.  
It defines how binary data (1s and 0s) are represented as **electrical, optical, or radio signals** that can travel through a medium and be correctly interpreted by the receiver.

## üîë Key Points

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Purpose of Encoding
- Encoding converts **binary data** from a sender into **physical signals** that can move through copper, fiber, or air.  
- The receiver then decodes these signals back into bits.

Typical two-level signal mapping:
- **High** ‚Üí represents `1`  
- **Low** ‚Üí represents `0`

These may correspond to:
- Two voltages (copper wire)  
- Two light intensities (optical fiber)  
- Two amplitude levels (radio signals)

### üíª 2. Role of the Network Adaptor
- The **network adaptor** (e.g., a NIC ‚Äî Network Interface Card) connects a computer to a link.  
- It handles **bit-level signaling**:
  - Encoding bits into signals (sender)
  - Decoding signals into bits (receiver)

**Conceptual flow:**
> Bits move between adaptors,  
> while signals travel between the adaptors over the medium.  

*(Refer to Figure 23 ‚Äî signals between adaptors, bits between computers.)*

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. The Challenge
Main encoding challenges:
1. **Signal Integrity** ‚Äì avoid baseline drift.  
2. **Clock Synchronization** ‚Äì maintain timing between sender and receiver.  
3. **Avoiding long runs of identical bits** ‚Äì ensure enough transitions for timing recovery.

When long sequences of `1`s or `0`s occur:
- **Baseline Wander:** receiver‚Äôs average signal drifts, blurring distinction between 0 and 1.  
- **Clock Recovery Issue:** without transitions, receiver loses sync with sender.

### üî§ 4. Common Encoding Schemes

#### (a) NRZ ‚Äî Non-Return to Zero
- Simplest form:  
  - `1 = High`, `0 = Low`
- Problem: long identical bits ‚Üí baseline wander, clock drift.  
- **Efficiency:** 100%

---

#### (b) NRZI ‚Äî Non-Return to Zero Inverted
- A **transition** represents a `1`; no transition represents a `0`.  
- Fixes long runs of 1s but fails for long runs of 0s.  
- **Efficiency:** 100%

---

#### (c) Manchester Encoding
- Combines **data** and **clock** signals to maintain synchronization.  
- Each bit period divided into two halves:  
  - `0` = low ‚Üí high transition  
  - `1` = high ‚Üí low transition  
- Guarantees frequent transitions ‚Üí easy clock recovery.  
- Downside: doubles the required bandwidth.  
- **Efficiency:** 50% (bit rate = ¬Ω baud rate)

**Differential Manchester:**  
- `1` = same phase as previous bit  
- `0` = opposite phase  
- More resistant to noise and phase shifts.

#### (d) Advanced Modulation (Beyond Binary)
Modern links encode **multiple bits per symbol** using multiple signal states:

| Levels | Bits per Symbol | Example |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| 4 levels | 2 bits | QAM-4 |
| 8 levels | 3 bits | QAM-8 |
| 16 or 64 levels | 4‚Äì6 bits | QAM-16 / QAM-64 |

**QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):**  
Combines **amplitude** and **phase** variations to encode data efficiently.

---

#### (e) 4B/5B Encoding
- Replaces every **4 bits** of data with a **5-bit code** that avoids long runs of zeros or ones.  
- Ensures:
  - ‚â§ 1 leading zero  
  - ‚â§ 2 trailing zeros  
- 5-bit sequences are sent using **NRZI** encoding.

**Efficiency:** 80% (4 bits of data ‚Üí 5 transmitted bits)

**Advantages:**
- Prevents long idle sequences.  
- Adds control codes for **framing** and **error states**.

| Data (4 bits) | Code (5 bits) |
|----------------|----------------|
| 0000 | 11110 |
| 0001 | 01001 |
| 0010 | 10100 |
| 0011 | 10101 |
| 0100 | 01010 |
| 0101 | 01011 |
| 0110 | 01110 |
| 0111 | 01111 |
| 1000 | 10010 |
| 1001 | 10011 |
| 1010 | 10110 |
| 1011 | 10111 |
| 1100 | 11010 |
| 1101 | 11011 |
| 1110 | 11100 |
| 1111 | 11101 |

**Special Codes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| 11111 | Idle line |
| 00000 | Dead line |
| 00100 | Halt signal |

### ‚öñÔ∏è 5. Efficiency Comparison

| Encoding | Transition Behavior | Clock Recovery | Efficiency |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **NRZ** | None during identical bits | Poor | 100% |
| **NRZI** | Transitions on `1`s only | Better | 100% |
| **Manchester** | Transition every bit | Excellent | 50% |
| **4B/5B (NRZI)** | Controlled zeros | Excellent | 80% |

---

### üß≠ 6. Takeaway
Encoding bridges the gap between **digital data** and **physical transmission**.  
It ensures that signals remain **interpretable, synchronized, and reliable**, even under noisy or imperfect conditions.  

The evolution from **NRZ ‚Üí Manchester ‚Üí 4B/5B** reflects a continual balance between:
- **Efficiency**
- **Synchronization**
- **Signal Integrity**

These principles remain fundamental to all modern communication systems ‚Äî from Ethernet to optical networks.
