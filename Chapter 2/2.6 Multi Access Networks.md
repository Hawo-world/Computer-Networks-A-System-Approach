# üß≠ 2.6 Multi-Access Networks (Ethernet)

Ethernet, developed at Xerox PARC in the mid-1970s, became the dominant LAN (Local Area Network) technology, evolving from early multi-access systems like ALOHA.  
It is based on the **Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detect (CSMA/CD)** protocol.

Even though modern Ethernets are mostly point-to-point (switch-based), understanding CSMA/CD provides foundational insight for shared-medium networks like Wi-Fi, which still use a variant of this algorithm.

## üîë Key Concepts

### 1. Definition and Principles

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **Carrier Sense (CS)** | A node ‚Äúlistens‚Äù to the network before transmitting; it can sense if the channel is busy. |
| **Multiple Access (MA)** | Multiple devices share the same communication channel (shared medium). |
| **Collision Detect (CD)** | Nodes detect collisions by monitoring the network as they transmit. |

**Analogy:** Think of Ethernet as a shared bus ‚Äî multiple computers (nodes) connected to the same cable, taking turns to speak.

### 2. Historical Context

- Originated from the **ALOHA** packet radio network (University of Hawaii).  
- The challenge: efficiently share a common medium without centralized control.  
- **Ethernet = ALOHA + Carrier Sensing + Collision Detection**  
- Jointly standardized in 1978 by Xerox, DEC, and Intel ‚Üí **IEEE 802.3** standard.  

**Speed Evolution:**  
10 Mbps ‚Üí 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet) ‚Üí 1 Gbps ‚Üí 10 Gbps ‚Üí 40 Gbps ‚Üí 100 Gbps+

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2.6.1 Physical Properties

### Classic Ethernet (Coaxial Bus)

- Original cable: 500 m coaxial segment.  
- Hosts ‚Äútapped‚Äù into the cable using a **transceiver**, connected to an Ethernet adaptor on the host.

**Transceiver Functions**
- Detects idle/busy line  
- Transmits/receives signals  

**Connecting Segments**
- **Repeaters / Hubs:** Extend signal across multiple segments.  
  - Operate at the **physical layer** (bit-level only).  
  - Maximum: 4 repeaters between any two hosts.  
  - Max total reach: ~2500 m (2.5 km).  
- All nodes still share the same **collision domain**.

**Signal Propagation**
- Any signal is broadcast across the entire Ethernet network.  
- **Terminators** at cable ends absorb signals and prevent reflection.  
- Original encoding: **Manchester encoding** (for synchronization).  
- Modern encoding: **4B/5B** or **8B/10B** for higher data rates.

**Collision Domain:**  
All hosts on the same physical medium (or hub-based LAN) share bandwidth and compete for access.  
A ‚Äúcollision domain‚Äù = all nodes that can collide if they transmit simultaneously.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2.6.2 Access Protocol (Media Access Control ‚Äî MAC)

### Ethernet Frame Format

| Field | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Preamble** | 8 bytes (64 bits) | Alternating 0s and 1s for synchronization |
| **Destination Address** | 6 bytes | 48-bit MAC address of recipient |
| **Source Address** | 6 bytes | 48-bit MAC address of sender |
| **Type** | 2 bytes | Identifies upper-layer protocol (e.g., IP, ARP) |
| **Data** | 46‚Äì1500 bytes | Payload; padded if shorter than 46 bytes |
| **CRC (Frame Check Sequence)** | 4 bytes | 32-bit cyclic redundancy check for error detection |

üëâ **Minimum frame = 64 bytes (512 bits)** ‚Üí necessary for collision detection.

---

### Ethernet Addresses

- **48-bit unique identifier (MAC address)**, assigned to the adaptor (hardware, not host).  
- Printed as six hexadecimal pairs: e.g. `08:00:2b:e4:b1:02`.  
- Vendors receive a unique 24-bit prefix (**OUI**) from IEEE to guarantee global uniqueness.

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Unicast** | Sent to a specific device (one-to-one). |
| **Broadcast** | Address = all 1s ‚Üí delivered to all hosts on the network. |
| **Multicast** | First bit = 1 (but not all 1s) ‚Üí sent to a subset of hosts that have subscribed to it. |

**Promiscuous Mode:**  
Adaptor accepts all frames (used in sniffing or monitoring).  

Adaptor accepts frames if:
- Address matches its own  
- Broadcast address  
- Subscribed multicast address  
- Or if in promiscuous mode

### Transmitter Algorithm (CSMA/CD)

#### Rules of Transmission
1. If idle: transmit immediately.  
2. If busy: wait until idle, then transmit after a **9.6 Œºs interframe gap**.  
3. If collision detected: send a **32-bit jamming signal**, stop, and retry later.

**Persistence:**  
Ethernet uses **1-persistent behavior**:  
Transmit immediately when line becomes idle (**p = 1**).  
Simpler than **p-persistent** systems (used in ALOHA), which transmit with **p < 1** to reduce simultaneous starts.

---

### Collision Detection Details
- A collision occurs when two (or more) nodes transmit at the same time.  
- When detected:
  - Each sender transmits a **32-bit jamming sequence**
