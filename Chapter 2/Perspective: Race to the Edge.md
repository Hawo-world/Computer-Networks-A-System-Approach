# üß≠ Perspective: Race to the Edge

## üåê Transformation of the Access Network

The **access network** ‚Äî the infrastructure that connects homes, businesses, and mobile devices to the Internet ‚Äî is experiencing a major transformation driven by **softwarization** (moving functions from hardware to software).

Traditionally, these networks relied on complex, closed, and proprietary hardware appliances such as:

- **OLT (Optical Line Terminal)**
- **BNG (Broadband Network Gateway)**
- **BBU (Baseband Unit)**
- **EPC (Evolved Packet Core)**

These devices bundled multiple proprietary functions, making them expensive, hard to manage, and slow to evolve.

## üñ•Ô∏è Transition to Software-Defined Infrastructure

To solve this, network operators are shifting from purpose-built hardware to **open software running on commodity servers, switches, and devices** ‚Äî mirroring how large-scale cloud data centers operate.

This transformation is known as:

- **CORD ‚Äì Central Office Re-architected as a Datacenter** (for telecom operators)  
- **HERD ‚Äì Head End Re-architected as a Datacenter** (for cable providers)

By reimagining the **Central Office as a mini data center**, operators gain:

- Lower costs via commodity hardware  
- Greater flexibility and faster innovation  
- The ability to support new, low-latency edge services like:
  - Public safety and smart city systems  
  - Autonomous vehicles  
  - Industrial automation and IoT  
  - Immersive / AR experiences

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Emergence of the Multi-Tier Cloud

The new Internet is evolving into a **multi-tier cloud model:**

1. **Datacenter-based public clouds** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)  
2. **Distributed, Internet Exchange Point (IXP)-hosted clouds** (~150 worldwide)  
3. **Access-based edge clouds**, such as CORD sites  

There could soon be **thousands of small, localized edge clouds** ‚Äî bringing compute and storage closer to users for **faster, real-time responsiveness.**

## ‚öîÔ∏è Cloud Providers vs. Network Operators

Both **cloud companies** and **network operators** are racing toward the edge, but their strategies differ.

### Cloud Providers‚Äô Vision
- Build **dense networks of edge clusters** in metro areas.  
- Treat access networks as **simple data pipes (‚Äúdumb bit-pipes‚Äù).**  
- Focus on **running scalable cloud services** efficiently on commodity hardware.

### Network Operators‚Äô Vision
- Transform the **access network itself into a cloud platform.**  
- **Co-locate applications** directly within the access network.  
- Leverage existing **infrastructure, mobility support, and service guarantees.**

Each side has unique strengths:  
- **Cloud providers** excel in scalability and global reach.  
- **Operators** control physical access points and have decades of operational expertise.

## üåç A Third Path: Democratizing the Edge

A promising third outcome is the **democratization of the network edge**, where anyone ‚Äî not just big tech or telecom companies ‚Äî can deploy and operate edge networks.

### Why This Is Becoming Possible
- **Open, commoditized technology** ‚Äì Hardware and software are now accessible to anyone, not just carriers.  
- **Rising enterprise demand** ‚Äì Businesses want **private 5G networks** for automation, robotics, and smart facilities.  
- **New spectrum availability** ‚Äì 5G introduces **unlicensed and lightly licensed spectrum (100‚Äì200 MHz)** in regions like the U.S. and Germany, enabling private use.

## üöÄ The Future of the Edge

The **softwarization and virtualization** of access networks could make it as easy to set up an **edge cloud** as it is today to install a Wi-Fi router.

This shift opens the door for:

- Smart cities and local communities  
- Rural and underserved regions  
- Enterprises and factories  
- Apartment complexes and campuses  

Ultimately, it brings **innovation to the edge**, empowering developers and organizations to create **local, real-time, and connected services** directly within their environments.

## üß© Summary Points

- Access networks are transitioning from **closed hardware systems** to **software-defined, open platforms.**  
- **CORD/HERD** exemplify this rearchitecture, using **cloud datacenter technology at the network edge.**  
- **Cloud providers and network operators** are converging toward the edge for control over **low-latency services.**  
- A **democratized edge** ‚Äî open to communities, industries, and developers ‚Äî could redefine how networks and cloud systems operate, merging **connectivity and compute** into one seamless ecosystem.
