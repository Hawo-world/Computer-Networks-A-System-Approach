# üß≠ 2.8 Access Networks

Beyond local connections like Ethernet and Wi-Fi, users connect to the Internet via **access (broadband) networks** provided by ISPs ‚Äî the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù that links customer homes and devices to the ISP‚Äôs national backbone.

Two major access technologies are:
- **Passive Optical Networks (PON)** ‚Äì fiber-to-the-home service.  
- **Cellular Networks (4G ‚Üí 5G)** ‚Äì mobile wireless broadband.  

Both are multi-access systems, but they manage shared-medium access very differently.

---

## üåê Context: ISP Architecture

ISPs operate **national backbones** connected to many **edge sites** serving regions or cities.

These edge sites are:
- **Central Offices (CO):** used in telco fiber networks.  
- **Head Ends:** used in cable systems.  

Despite their ‚Äúcentral‚Äù name, these facilities sit at the **edge** of the ISP network.  
PON and Cellular RANs are anchored here.  
(DSL, the copper-based predecessor to PON, is being phased out.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2.8.1 Passive Optical Network (PON)

### Structure and Operation
**Topology:** Tree-shaped, point-to-multipoint network.

**Components:**
- **OLT (Optical Line Terminal)** ‚Äì in ISP Central Office.  
- **Splitters** ‚Äì passive optical devices branching the fiber to many customers (up to ~1024).  
- **ONU (Optical Network Unit)** ‚Äì in each home or business.  
- **Agg Switch + BNG (Broadband Network Gateway)** ‚Äì aggregate traffic and link to the Internet/backbone.

üìò **Passive** means: Splitters do not regenerate or buffer frames; they simply forward optical signals ‚Äî like analog repeaters in early Ethernet.

---

### Traffic Direction

| Direction | Medium | Method | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Downstream (ISP ‚Üí user)** | Optical | Broadcast | OLT sends data to all ONUs; each ONU filters frames by its ID. Encryption prevents eavesdropping. |
| **Upstream (user ‚Üí ISP)** | Optical | TDM (Time-Division Multiplexing) | Each ONU transmits only during an assigned time slot (grant). |

ONUs are at different physical distances, so they cannot share a synchronized clock.  
The **OLT centrally schedules grants**, assigning each ONU specific time windows.  
The OLT may allocate unequal shares for **tiered services (bandwidth control).**

---

### Evolution

| Version | Meaning | Typical Bandwidth |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| **G-PON** | Gigabit PON | ~2.25 Gbps |
| **XGS-PON** | 10 Gigabit PON | ~10 Gbps |

PON continues to evolve for higher capacity and better QoS.

## üì± 2.8.2 Cellular Network

### Overview
Modern cellular systems evolved from analog voice to full-data broadband wireless access.  
Uses **licensed spectrum** (700 MHz ‚Äì 2400 MHz typical; 6 GHz and 24 GHz+ mmWave for 5G).  
Operators obtain exclusive rights via **frequency auctions.**

Unlike Wi-Fi‚Äôs open 2.4/5 GHz bands, cellular bands are tightly controlled.

---

### CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) ‚Äì 3.5 GHz Unlicensed Band (USA)
Allows creation of **private cellular networks** (e.g., campuses, factories).

Three-tier sharing model:
1. **Incumbents** ‚Äì naval radar and satellite users.  
2. **Priority Access License (PAL)** holders ‚Äì regional licensees.  
3. **General Authorized Access (GAA)** ‚Äì public users if no conflict (checked via database).

---

### Architecture and Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **UE (User Equipment)** | Phones, IoT devices, etc. |
| **BBU (Broadband Base Unit)** | Base station (also called eNodeB or gNodeB). |
| **EPC (Evolved Packet Core)** | Core network in the Central Office that connects the RAN to the Internet. |
| **RAN (Radio Access Network)** | Collection of BBUs + antennas serving a region. |

---

### Evolved Packet Core (EPC) Components

| Module | Function |
|---------|-----------|
| **MME (Mobility Management Entity)** | Tracks UE locations and controls handoffs. |
| **HSS (Home Subscriber Server)** | Subscriber database (authentication + account data). |
| **S/PGW (Session/Packet Gateway)** | Handles packet routing and Internet connectivity (user plane). |

An EPC can serve multiple Central Offices and large regions.  
In some cases, **PON fiber links** carry traffic between remote BBUs and the Central Office.

---

### Cell and Handoff Concepts
- The area served by one BBU‚Äôs antenna = a **cell.**  
- Cells overlap slightly; a UE communicates with one BBU at a time.  
- When the UE moves between cells:
  - Signal strength is monitored.  
  - MME coordinates a **handoff** to the stronger BBU.  
  - Active sessions continue seamlessly.

### Generational Evolution

| Generation | Key Capability | Typical Data Rate |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **1G‚Äì2G** | Analog ‚Üí digital voice only | Kbps |
| **3G** | Introduced mobile data | Hundreds of Kbps |
| **4G (LTE)** | Full broadband data | 1‚Äì5 Mbps typical |
| **5G** | Next generation multi-waveform broadband | 10√ó faster (10‚Äì50 Mbps+) |

Standards defined by **3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project).**  
Each generation = a new release (**Release 15 marks transition to 5G**).  
**LTE (Long-Term Evolution)** = continuous progression from 3G to 5G.

---

### LTE Access Mechanism

Unlike Wi-Fi‚Äôs **contention-based CSMA/CA**, LTE uses **reservation-based OFDMA.**  
Cellular networks assume high utilization and explicitly allocate spectrum per user.

#### OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access)
- Divides the radio band into **12 orthogonal subcarriers (~15 kHz each).**  
- Each subcarrier modulated independently (16-QAM ‚Üí 4 bits/symbol, 64-QAM ‚Üí 6 bits/symbol).  
- Multiple users transmit simultaneously on different subcarriers and time slots.

üìä **Scheduling Grid:**  
Time √ó Frequency grid of **Resource Elements (REs).**  
1 RE = 15 kHz √ó 1 OFDMA symbol.  
7 √ó 12 RE = 1 **Physical Resource Block (PRB).**  
Scheduler allocates PRBs to users based on **channel quality feedback (CQI).**  
Feedback interval ‚âà **1 ms (Transmission Time Interval ‚Äì TTI).**

---

### 4G ‚Üí 5G Enhancements

5G introduces multiple **waveforms** optimized for different bands and applications.

| Band Range | Max Bandwidth | Subcarrier Spacings | Scheduling Interval | Target Use |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **< 1 GHz** | 50 MHz | 15 kHz / 30 kHz | 0.5 ms / 0.25 ms | Long-range coverage, IoT |
| **1‚Äì6 GHz** | 100 MHz | 15 / 30 / 60 kHz | 0.5 / 0.25 / 0.125 ms | Mobile broadband & critical apps |
| **> 24 GHz (mmWave)** | 400 MHz | 60 / 120 kHz | 0.125 ms | Short-range ultra-high-speed links |

The scheduler can now adjust both **allocation and waveform size per device.**  
5G accommodates diverse devices (e.g., phones, cars, sensors) and low-latency apps.

---

### Scheduling Goals
- Maximize spectrum utilization.  
- Guarantee per-user QoS (service level).  
- Scheduling algorithms are **proprietary to vendors** (not defined by 3GPP).
