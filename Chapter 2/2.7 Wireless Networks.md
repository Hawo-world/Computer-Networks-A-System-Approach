# üß≠ 2.7 Wireless Networks

Wireless networks share many concepts with wired links (framing, reliability, and error detection) but also introduce unique challenges ‚Äî limited power, unpredictable noise, interference, and open-air transmission.  
They require careful management of medium access, frequency use, and security.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Differences vs Wired Links

| Concern | Wired | Wireless |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Error rate** | Usually low | Higher due to noise/interference |
| **Power** | Not an issue | Critical for mobile/battery devices |
| **Medium** | Controlled (cable) | Shared & open (radio waves) |
| **Access control** | Physical connections | Radio sharing; interference possible |
| **Security** | Physical isolation | Easy eavesdropping; must encrypt |

Because radio signals radiate in all directions, wireless links are inherently multi-access, meaning multiple nodes can ‚Äúhear‚Äù one another.  
Thus, **Media Access Control (MAC)** and interference avoidance are central issues.

## üîë 2.7.1 Basic Issues

### 1. Spectrum and Frequency Allocation
- **Electromagnetic spectrum** divided by frequency (Hz).  
- Government agencies (e.g., **FCC** in U.S.) allocate frequency bands for specific uses:  
  - **Licensed bands:** purchased/leased (e.g., cellular carriers).  
  - **Unlicensed bands:** (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz) ‚Üí public use with power limits.  
- Power limits reduce interference and signal range (e.g., cordless phone ‚âà 30 m).

---

### 2. Spread Spectrum Techniques
Used to minimize interference and allow multiple users to share the same band.

#### a. Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
- Transmitter ‚Äúhops‚Äù among multiple frequencies in a pseudorandom sequence.  
- Receiver knows the same sequence and follows in sync.  
- Makes collisions with other signals rare and short-lived.

#### b. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
- Each bit ‚Üí expanded into multiple ‚Äúchipped‚Äù bits using a chipping code.  
- Adds redundancy so errors can be corrected.  
- Spreads signal across a wider band ‚Üí higher resilience to noise.

üìò **Example:** A 4-bit chipping sequence means each original bit is XORed with 4 pseudo-random bits.

---

### 3. Topology and Mobility Models

#### a. Base Station Topology
- Central node (**Access Point or Base Station**) connects to the wired Internet.  
- Clients connect through it ‚Äî not directly to each other.  
- Supports three mobility levels:
  - Fixed (antenna in place)
  - Mobile within range (e.g., Bluetooth)
  - Mobile between bases (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular)

#### b. Mesh or Ad Hoc Topology
- No base station.  
- Nodes forward packets for each other ‚Üí multi-hop routing.  

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Extended range, fault tolerance, incremental growth | Higher power use, hardware cost, and complexity |

Used in **sensor networks** and research meshes.

## üì∂ 2.7.2 Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)

### Physical Properties and Standards

| Standard | Band | Method | Max Rate | Notes |
|-----------|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 802.11 (original) | 2.4 GHz | FHSS / DSSS | 2 Mbps | First Wi-Fi spec |
| 802.11b | 2.4 GHz | DSSS variant | 11 Mbps | Widely used early |
| 802.11a | 5 GHz | OFDM | 54 Mbps | Higher freq, shorter range |
| 802.11g | 2.4 GHz | OFDM | 54 Mbps | Backward compatible with b |
| 802.11n | 2.4 / 5 GHz | MIMO + OFDM | 150‚Äì450 Mbps | Multiple antennas |
| 802.11ac | 5 GHz | Advanced MIMO + wide channels | 450 Mbps+ | Gigabit Wi-Fi |
| 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) | 2.4 / 5 GHz | OFDMA + MIMO | 600 Mbps+ | Shares tech with 4G/5G |

üí° **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)** ‚Üí uses multiple antennas for parallel transmissions, boosting speed and reliability.  
Devices automatically select bit rates based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and packet success rates.

---

### Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
Wi-Fi uses **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance**, not collision detection (CSMA/CD).

#### Challenges
- **Hidden node problem:** Nodes A and C can‚Äôt hear each other, but both collide at B.  
- **Exposed node problem:** Node C hears B transmitting but could still safely transmit to D.

#### Solutions
- **Carrier Sense:** Listen before sending.  
- **ACKs:** Receiver confirms successful receipt.  
- **RTS/CTS Handshake:**  
  - Sender ‚Üí RTS; receiver ‚Üí CTS.  
  - Neighbors hearing CTS remain silent for specified time.  
  - Reduces hidden node collisions.  
- **Exponential Backoff:** If no CTS or ACK, wait random delay and retry.

---

### Distribution System and Mobility
Wi-Fi uses **Access Points (APs)** connected by a wired distribution system (e.g., Ethernet).  
Each node associates with one AP at a time.

#### Joining an AP ‚Äì Scanning Process
1. Node sends **Probe frame**.  
2. Nearby APs reply with **Probe Response**.  
3. Node chooses AP ‚Üí sends **Association Request**.  
4. AP responds with **Association Response**.

- **Active Scanning:** Node sends probes.  
- **Passive Scanning:** Node listens for AP **Beacon frames**.

#### Roaming Between Cells
When signal weakens, node switches to another AP with stronger signal ‚Üí new AP notifies old AP via distribution system.

---

### Frame Format
Similar to Ethernet but with **four address fields (max)**.  
**ToDS / FromDS** bits determine how addresses are interpreted (used for forwarding through APs).

Includes:
- Control field (Type, ToDS, FromDS)
- 48-bit source/destination addresses
- Up to 2312 bytes data
- 32-bit CRC

---

### Wireless Security
Wireless links can be overheard or abused.  
Thus, 802.11 implements security mechanisms for:

- **Data confidentiality:** encryption (e.g., WPA2, WPA3).  
- **Access control:** authentication before joining network.  
- **Integrity checking:** CRC + encryption.

Operates in **2.45 GHz unlicensed band**.  
1 ‚Äì 3 Mbps typical data rate.

---

### Architecture
**Piconet** = 1 master + up to 7 active slaves  
(plus up to 255 ‚Äúparked‚Äù inactive slaves)

- Only the **master initiates communication**.  
- Slaves cannot transmit without master prompt.  
- **Low-power design** saves battery.

---

### Operation

Each channel used for **625 Œºs ‚Üí time-division slots.**  
- Master transmits in odd slots; slaves respond in even slots.  
- Reduces contention and interference.

---

### Extensions and Alternatives
- Managed by **Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group)**.  
- Defines higher-level **profiles** for applications (e.g., audio, file transfer).  
- Related low-power standard: **ZigBee (802.15.4)**  
  - Very low bandwidth but ultra-low power for sensor networks.
