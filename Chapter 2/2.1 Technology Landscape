# üåê Chapter 2 ‚Äî Technology Landscape

## üìò Summary
Before exploring how to connect network nodes effectively, it‚Äôs important to understand the diverse **technologies that form the foundation of modern network links**.  

This section provides an overview of link types ‚Äî from the massive fiber cables connecting global routers to the Wi-Fi and cellular networks that bring everyday users online.  

Despite their differences, all these technologies share a single goal: **to reliably carry bits between devices and make the Internet appear seamless and uniform** to users and routers.

## üîë Key Points

### üåé 1. Diversity of Network Links
Network links vary widely in **scale and purpose**:

| Link Type | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Global Backbone Links** | Span hundreds or thousands of kilometers, connecting large routers in ISPs and data centers. |
| **Local Access Links** | Connect end-user devices (laptops, phones, routers) to ISPs using Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular. |

From an end-user‚Äôs view, all these connections appear as simple ‚Äúlines‚Äù between devices ‚Äî hiding immense complexity beneath.

### üß† 2. Unified Network Abstraction
One of the network‚Äôs greatest strengths is **abstraction** ‚Äî hiding physical differences between technologies.  

- A smartphone doesn‚Äôt need to know whether it‚Äôs on Wi-Fi, 5G, or fiber ‚Äî it only knows it‚Äôs connected to the Internet.  
- Routers forward packets across diverse links, trusting lower layers to handle reliability.  

This abstraction makes the Internet scalable and device-independent, despite huge differences in physical media.

### ‚ö° 3. Physical Media and Signal Basics
All links transmit **electromagnetic (EM) signals** through some physical medium.

#### Common Media:
- **Copper wires:** twisted pair (Ethernet, DSL), coaxial (cable Internet).  
- **Optical fiber:** high-speed backbone and fiber-to-the-home networks.  
- **Air / Free Space:** wireless transmission (radio, infrared, microwave).

#### Frequency and Wavelength:
- **Frequency (Hz):** how fast EM waves oscillate.  
- **Wavelength (m):** distance between peaks = *speed of light in medium √∑ frequency*.  
  - Example: A 300 Hz signal through copper (speed ‚âà 2√ó10‚Å∏ m/s) ‚Üí wavelength ‚âà 667 km.

#### The Electromagnetic Spectrum:
Spans radio ‚Üí infrared ‚Üí visible light ‚Üí x-rays.  
Different **frequency bands** are allocated for different technologies.

**Cellular frequency ranges:**
- Traditional cellular: 700 MHz ‚Äì 2400 MHz  
- Mid-band: around 6 GHz  
- **Millimeter-wave (mmWave):** above 24 GHz (used in 5G for high bandwidth over short distances)

### üî§ 4. Encoding and Modulation
All link technologies must **encode binary data** (1s and 0s) into EM signals.

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Modulation (lower layer)** | Varies wave properties (frequency, amplitude, or phase) to represent data. |
| **Encoding (upper layer)** | Maps bits to signal states (e.g., ‚Äúhigh‚Äù = 1, ‚Äúlow‚Äù = 0). |

Example: turning a light on/off to represent bits (amplitude modulation).  
This chapter focuses more on **encoding** and less on physical modulation physics.

### üß© 5. Link Classification by Use
Different link types serve different technical and economic roles:

#### (a) Last-Mile / Access Networks
Connect individuals or businesses to the Internet via an ISP.  
Optimized for **cost efficiency and accessibility**.

| Service | Medium | Bandwidth | Notes |
|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| **DSL** | Copper | up to 100 Mbps | Uses existing telephone lines. |
| **G.Fast** | Copper | up to 1 Gbps | Optimized for short distances (e.g., apartment buildings). |
| **PON (Passive Optical Network)** | Fiber | up to 10 Gbps | Used for fiber-to-the-home broadband. |
| **4G / 5G Cellular** | Wireless | up to multi-Gbps | Enables mobility and wireless home Internet. |

#### (b) Backbone Networks
High-capacity, long-distance links connecting ISPs, cities, and countries.  
- Dominated by **optical fiber**.  
- Common tech: **SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)** ‚Äî built for carrier-grade reliability.

#### (c) Local Area Networks (LANs)
Short-range networks connecting computers in homes, offices, or campuses.
- **Ethernet:** standard wired LAN.  
- **Wi-Fi:** wireless LAN counterpart.

### üí° 6. Takeaway
The Internet is built on a **diverse ecosystem of link technologies**, but thanks to **standardized protocols and abstraction**, it all feels like one unified system.  

Understanding the physical and economic differences between local, access, and backbone networks helps explain why networking technologies evolve differently ‚Äî and why certain trade-offs exist.

Later sections dive deeper into **how bits are encoded, transmitted, and made reliable** across these link types.
